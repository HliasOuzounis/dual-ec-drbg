# Analysis of the backdoor of the DUAL EC DRBG algorithm

This project is an analysis of the DUAL EC DRGB algorithm proposed by NIST in 2006. Despite the backlash and the possibility of the existance of a backdoor, the algorihtm was standardized until 2014 when it was finally removed from the NIST standards.

The goal of this project was to understand the theory behind an elliptic curve algorithm and how the backdoor could have been designed. The effectiveness of the bakcdoor is also analyzed through some custom examples that simulate the potential backdoor.

The project was written in `Python`. The code is available in the `src` folder and the report is available in the `report` folder.
